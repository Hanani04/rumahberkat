        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">	The Johor Orphan Welfare Organization (PKAYJ) was built on a 4-acre plot of land located on Jalan Bukut Cagar, Johor Bahru. The building site was endowed by the Johor Islamic Religious Council. This office building was originally a board building with two pillars under which there was a vault that housed some of the staff. In 2012, the Rumah Barkat office was transformed and built using ready-made stone at a cost of RM 2 million. The cost of building this house is a building built by donations from the public. This house is located under the management of the Johor Orphan Welfare Organization (PKAYJ). This foundation was established with the aim of defending orphans throughout the state.</br></br>

	Next, the construction of Rumah Barkat is one of the efforts to help orphans who are in school and in line with the goal of its establishment to care for orphans and orphans who have no place to live and guide them towards academic achievement and good morals. Students funded by PKAYJ will be given financial assistance of RM 45.00 per month for each person. In addition, students are given donations and learning facilities such as exam fees, textbooks, clothes and other schooling needs according to their individual needs. In addition, to facilitate the distribution of aid money to orphans and poor children who are in school, we credit the payment to their respective accounts and the Muamalat account book. The Johor Orphans Welfare Organization (PKAYJ) was established on Sunday 1978 located in the Office Operations Room District, Jalan Duke Johor Bahru, Johor DarulTakzim. With the full spirit of awareness and conscience of businessmen, volunteers, organizations, politics, voluntary welfare, government officials and businessmen who were present on that day have agreed to establish P.K.A.Y.J to provide assistance, help , guidance and spiritual and physical education so that these orphans/orphans become a well-protected and pious person.</br></br>

	On 30 October 1979 the State Government of Johor Darul Takzim has lent a house to its officers at address no. 118, Jalan Bukit Cagar, 80300 Johor Bahru, JohorDarul Takzim to this organization and P.K.A.Y.J named it "RUMAH BARKAT".</p>
